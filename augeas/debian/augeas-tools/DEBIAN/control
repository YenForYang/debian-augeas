Description: Augeas command line tools
 Augeas is a configuration editing tool. It parses configuration files in their
 native formats and transforms them into a tree. Configuration changes are made
 by manipulating this tree and saving it back into native config files.
 .
 This package provides command line tools based on libaugeas0:
 - augtool, a tool to manage configuration files.
 - augparse, a testing and debugging tool for augeas lenses.
