Description: Augeas configuration editing library and API
 Augeas is a configuration editing tool. It parses configuration files in their
 native formats and transforms them into a tree. Configuration changes are made
 by manipulating this tree and saving it back into native config files.
 .
 The transformation works very hard to preserve comments and formatting
 details. It is controlled by ``lens'' definitions that describe the file
 format and the transformation into a tree.
